# Hello Peeps

# Project Name : SWOT ANALYSIS GENERATOR
# Description: 
This is part of my most frustating activity. I just want to automate the stuff. Like my college ppl are always want me to write SWOT analysis for joining any clubs kind of things. So what I done is like I made a website which takes Text as input and then gives swot analysis page with a background image and your text. You can take scrrenshot of that and submit it :).

# SETUP ENVIRONMENT: Nothing more it is just based on HTML and CSS with JAVASCRIPT.(NODEJS is preferred but not essential)
